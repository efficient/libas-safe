Various and sundry dynamic linkingâ€“related gotchas
==================================================
This branch contains a number of small demo programs I wrote while tinkering around with dynamic
linking and other low-level userland runtime details in the process of writing the _libgotcha_
runtime.  Many of them were merely experiments thrown together to demonstrate behavior and edge
cases.  Some of them (e.g., `bind_not`, `copy`, `interpose`) implement isolated parts of
_libgotcha_'s functionality and may have some reuse value to those unafraid of reading scary,
undocumented code.  Others (e.g., `nested`, `nptl-skip_init`) were used to debug past bugs in
_libgotcha_.  Your best hope of recovering the context/history of these files is to run `git log` on
them and read the messages.

**Chances are the thing you'll find most interesting is the example program in the `posix_safety`
directory, which demonstrates how the _libas-safe_ runtime can automatically resolve deadlocks in
programs with incorrect signal handlers.**
